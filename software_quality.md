# Three Câ€™s of Software Quality stands for Competency, Completeness, and Correctness.

## Correctness: 
This refers to the ability of software to perform its intended functions correctly and without errors or bugs. Correctness is a fundamental aspect of software quality, as it ensures that the software meets the requirements and expectations of its users.

## Completeness: 
This refers to the degree to which the software application fulfills all its specified requirements and performs all its intended functions. Completeness is important because it ensures that the software meets the needs of its users and performs all the tasks it was designed to do.

## Consistency: 
This refers to the degree to which the software application behaves in a uniform and predictable manner across different platforms and environments. Consistency is important because it ensures that the software is reliable and can be used by a wide range of users in different situations.

# Excercises to increase Quality

## Ad Hoc and Exploratory Testing
Ad hoc and exploratory testing go into the manual side of testing. The main idea is to explore creativity and push the boundaries of testing practices. There are no rules to this, and exploratory testing is conducted on the fly at any moment. This approach benefits developers in testing software usability and user behaviours.

Ad hoc testing uses random data to generate tests and aims to break or disrupt software services. Its objective is to find vulnerabilities and is usually done near the end of the development process.

## Increase test usefuleness
By increasing the usefulness of tests, you can increase the quality of your software. This is because tests are a way to ensure that your software is working as intended and that it is not breaking any rules or regulations.

Haveing tests that run quickly and easily is a good way to increase the usefulness of your tests. This is because it allows you to run them more often and catch bugs earlier in the development process.

## Create and Maintain a risk register
A risk register is a document that contains all the risks that a project may face. It is used to identify and manage risks, and it can be used as a tool for communication between stakeholders.

## Performance Testing
Performance testing is a type of testing that measures the performance of a system under a specific workload. It is used to determine the speed, responsiveness, and stability of a system. Knowing how your system will perform under different conditions can help you make informed decisions about your system architecture and design.

## Dependency Management
Making sure that dependencties are kept up to date is a good way to increase the quality of your software. This is because it ensures that your software is using the latest versions of dependencies, which can help prevent bugs and security vulnerabilities.

# Ordered List of Priorities
1.) Increase test usefuleness
2.) Dependency Management
3.) Create and Maintain a risk register
4.) Performance Testing
5.) Ad Hoc and Exploratory Testing
